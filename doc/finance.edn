;; # Financial Data Schemas

;; ## Financial Quantities

;; A financial quantity represents an amount of a commodity, such as "$3.27".
;; This is stored as an exact-decimal numeric amount and a commodity code
;; symbol. In EDN, this is represented by a tagged-literal vector containing
;; the amount and code.

#finance/$ [-25.73M USD]
#finance/$ [0.1M BTC]
#finance/$ [50M TSLA]



;; ## System Layout

;; The financial system is laid out as a tree of data from a single root. The
;; system allows for tracking multiple independent _books_ each of which has
;; a balanced tree of accounts which obey the accounting equation.
;;
;; Within each set of books, a tree of accounts is used in the _journal_, which
;; contains a sequence of _transactions_. Each transaction contains a balanced
;; set of _postings_ which modify account balances.
;;
;; All ledgers in the system share a common set of commodity definitions and
;; prices.

;; ## Commodities

;; A commodity is defined by a symbolic code, a name, and a type. It may also
;; have a character symbol and a format example.
;;
;; Commodity definitions are stored under `/commodities`, which should be a
;; link table from code symbols to definitions. Thus, the definition of US
;; dollars could be found at `/commodities/USD`.
;;
;; - title*       formal name of the commodity
;; - code*        symbolic code used for the commodity (e.g., USD, BTC, AMZN, etc.)
;; - asset-class  keyword for the commodity type: currency, stock, bond, mutual-fund, etc.
;; - symbol       a single-character symbol for the commodity, if available
;; - format       example amount string which specifies the formatting for the commodity
;;
;; TODO: method to list the asset class breakdown for funds

;; ## Prices

;; Over time, a commodity's value may change relative to other commodities. In
;; particular, currencies fluctuate and the values of investments grow and
;; shrink. The conversion rate between two commodities determines the primary
;; commodity's _price_ in the second (or 'base') commodity.
;;
;; These are stored in a 'price-list' structure, which is a sequence of
;; maps containing the following keys:
;; - at*         time the price point was observed
;; - commodity*  the primary commodity being priced
;; - price*      unit value of the primary commodity in the base units
;; - source      string describing the source of the data

;; ## Accounts

;; Accounts are named containers for commodities. Accounts are structured into a
;; hierarchy, forming a tree of accounts. The top-level accounts should be
;; things like 'Assets', 'Liabilities', 'Income', 'Expenses', etc.
;;
;; GOALS:
;; - Be able to update account information and hierarchy WITHOUT needing to
;;   update the transaction history.
;; - Be able to move a subtree of accounts WITHOUT needing to update the accounts
;;   in the subtree.
;;
;; To this end, accounts are given a stable identifier by creating an
;; `account-root` structure and linking all postings and metadata to it. The
;; opening data should include enough unique information to identify the
;; represented account.
;;
;; The accounts are organized into a tree from a top-level root of `/accounts`.
;; Each account gives its segment name (via `:title`) and links to any child
;; accounts.
;;
;; - id              link to the opening event (for accounts with a journal)
;; - type*           type of account, e.g. :group, :checking, :savings, :brokerage, etc.
;; - institution     name of the institution the account is with, if any
;; - external-id     external account identifier string
;; - commodities     set of commodity codes allowed in the account, if restricted
;; - interest-rate   APR paid/charged, if any
;; - children        set of links to child accounts
;; - depreciation?   information about depreciaton method, period, lifespan, etc.

;; ## Transactions

;; Transactions tie together multiple _postings_ into a balanced unit. The
;; amounts within a transaction MUST sum to zero. Postings are applied in order
;; within the transaction. Transactions are organized into a _journal_ in a
;; time-ordered sequence.
;;
;; - time      Time the transaction occurred.
;; - entries   Set of entries grouped into this transaction.
;; - state     Whether the transaction has cleared or is still pending.

;; ## Postings

;; An account has a _register_, which is the linear sequence of _postings_
;; applied to it. A posting is usually an amount change, but may also contain
;; balance checks and general notes. Postings are primarily sorted by timestamp,
;; but ones with the same timestamp (usually because of day-level precision) are
;; ordered by transaction placement in the history.
;;
;; - id            optional string uniquely identifying this posting so it can be
;;                 linked to another posting
;; - account*      Reference to the account (via the opening data) the posting
;;                 should be applied to.
;; - payee         Link to the entity on the other side of the posting, if any.
;; - balances      A balance check asserts that an account has a certain balance
;;                 of some set of commodities. If a commodity is not present in
;;                 the balance map, it is not checked. To assert that an account
;;                 has none of a given commodity, it should be specified with a
;;                 value of zero.
;; - amount        Quantity of commodity which changed.
;; - price         A price in another commodity which the amount was exchanged for.
;; - cost          A cost associated with the original commodity lot.
;; - items         A list of itemized

;; ## Line Items

;; A line item represents a transacted amount of a product at a certain price.
;; A common example is a line on a receipt, showing the purchase of an item.
;;
;; Typically, the _amount_ will be a bare number or a physical quantity. The
;; _price_ is the unit price of the item, as a financial quantity. The _total_
;; multiplies the two and takes the commodity specified in the price. This is
;; rendered like:
;;
;;     $20.18 (2.0 lb @ $10.09)
;;
;; When the amount is a financial quantity and the price is a regular number,
;; it's considered to be a percentage of the amount. One common example is tax,
;; which is applied as a fraction of the bill total. This is rendered like:
;;
;;     $12.22 ($127.29 @ 9.6%)
